## **Empowering Compliance, Privacy, and Scalability for Web 3.0 Applications**

Swisstronik empowers Web 3.0 and traditional companies to easily construct KYC, AML, and DPR compliant products while maintaining a perfect balance between privacy, accountability, and decentralization. Here's how we enable this:

- We develop a self-regulating network of top KYC and AML providers, regulatory bodies, and compliance partners per jurisdiction. This network enables seamless yet compliant cross-border operation of clients' applications built on Swisstronik.

- We facilitate DPR compliance by allowing clients to keep sensitive data private and hidden through a unique combination of cutting-edge data protection methods: programmable protection technology based on Intel SGX and cryptographic protection technology based on Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs).

- We provide a comprehensive set of customizable non-custodial utilities (DID, ZK transactions, decentralized messenger, etc.) while focusing on Swisstronik blockchain interoperability and scalability. This allows businesses to rapidly deploy advanced applications with minimum costs.

## **Accelerate Your Development Journey with Swisstronik's Versatile Blockchain and Plug-and-Play Tools**

- The Swisstronik blockchain itself provides developers with a foundation to build various types of apps.

- A wide range of plug-and-play utilities are available for developers to speed up and simplify their development process. These utilities, such as DID solutions, ZK transfers, decentralized oracles, bridges, and decentralized messenger, are built directly into Swisstronik's nodes, eliminating the need for separate deployment.

- Stand-alone open-source apps cater to a diverse array of B2B and B2C use cases. Our Swisstronik utility set aims to be broader and more convenient for developers compared to standard L1 projects.
